# Percolation
Given an n by n grid, calculates how many grid sites must be open in order for the top row of the grid to connect to the bottom.
Was created for Princeton's Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms Course (Part I). 
Percolation.java utilizes the Weighted Union Find algorithm to find the percolation threshold, the percentage of sites that must be open in order for the grid's top row and bottom row to connect. 
PercolationStats.java takes an n by n grid and performs a given number of trials on it and returns the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, and the 95% confidence interval for the percolation threshold.
